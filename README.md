# Power-BI-Supply-Chain-Analysis

## Introduction 
Here, you'll discover an illustrative example demonstrating the approach to analyzing supply chain processes, covering production, sourcing, and product distribution.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI

In this project, Power BI serves as the primary software for data analysis and manipulation. It provides a powerful platform for interacting with databases and generating insightful visualizations.

## Data Source 

The data utilized in this repository consists of a meticulously crafted dataset designed specifically for demonstration and testing purposes. It's essential to understand that this dataset is synthetic and does not represent real-world order data or contain any customer information. Its primary objective is to create a simulated environment for honing Tableau skills.

The dataset includes various attributes such as Order ID, product details, quantity ordered, unit price, order date, and purchase address. While it mirrors the structure of order data, it may not encompass the full complexity of real-world scenarios.

Three distinct datasets are employed to store information:

Quotes Table
Internal Manufacturing Estimates Table
Product Dimensions

 ## Analysis

Explore the analysis presentation to delve into insights derived from the data. We've curated key findings and visualizations to offer a comprehensive understanding of supply chain dynamics, including:
